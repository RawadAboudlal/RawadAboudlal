		<h1>This is what you are here for</h1>
		<p>I am Rawad Aboudlal. I pretty much know Java inside out and also know basic html, css, javascript, php (though we do <b>not</b> talk about it) and very basic C/C++. I know my around python (the programming language) and I can make basic android apps as well.</p>
		<p>I can also help with computer issues. I am fairly confident in fixing software issues and I can do also try fixing hardware issues as well. I can put together a computer, if that is what you need, or upgrade and existing one/take it apart.</p>
		<h1>This is what you are not here for</h1>
		<p>I can not make things look good; I am a programmer, not a graphics designer.</p>
		<h1>Contact Info</h1>

			<li>Meetings or phone calls (which one depends on what you need).</li>
			<li>Price. This should come <b>after</b> you tell me what the project is. The price might change over time depending on any extra work that needs to be done.</li>
